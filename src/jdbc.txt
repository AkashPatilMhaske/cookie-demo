# Static block:
    - it is a block of code which is executed only once at the time class loading
    - To execute static block we need to load the class into the memory.
    - To load the class into the memory we have two ways:
        1. by creating object of a class
            - in this way there will be confusion which constructor to call
            - so to avoid this confusion we can use Class.forName()
        2. by using Class.forName("completeClassNameWithPackage");
