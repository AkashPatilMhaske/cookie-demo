# Static block:
    - it is a block of code which is executed only once at the time class loading
    - To execute static block we need to load the class into the memory.
    - To load the class into the memory we have two ways:
        1. by creating object of a class
            - in this way there will be confusion which constructor to call
            - so to avoid this confusion we can use Class.forName()
        2. by using Class.forName("completeClassNameWithPackage");

# What is Database?
    - it is a structured data stored physically on the file system.
    - database can be present on local machine or remote machine
    - to access database we need,
           - URL of the database
           - username and password
           - port number on which database is available
    - Types of Databases:
        1. relational databases:
            -data stored in rows and column
            - no. Of columns are same for all the records/rows
            -Mysql
            -oracle
            -postgres
            - microsoft sql-server
        2. NoSQl Databases
            - data stored in document format
            - no. Of columns are not same for all the records/rows
            - mongodb
            - cassendra
            -redis
# what is DBMS?
    - DBMS stands for Database Management Systems/Software
    - these systems helps in manipulating database files.
        - we can create new database
        - we can delete/drop database
        - we can CRUD the tables inside the database
    - DBMS provides the SQL[Structured Query Language] queries to work on DBMS

# What is database client software?
    - mysql workbench
    -https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/


# What is database server software?
    - mysql community server software
    https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/#:~:text=MySQL%20Community%20Edition%20is%20a,open%20source%20developers%20and%20enthusiasts.

Database Setup steps:

1. Download and install Database server software
    https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/#:~:text=MySQL%20Community%20Edition%20is%20a,open%20source%20developers%20and%20enthusiasts.
        - user setup
       - by default username will be root
   - database server will be the owner of the databases
   - DSS will manage

2. Download and install Database client software
    https://dbeaver.io/
    or
    we can use command prompt as a DB client software

3. start the database server software

4. Connect to the Database server software using DB client or command promt
    export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH
    open the CMD and hit : mysql -u user_name -p and hit the enter
     password
    will be connected to the database server software


5. We can give instructions to the server using client
    - create new DB : create database DATABASE_NAME;
    - see existing databases available: show databases;
    - delete existing DB : drop database DATABASE_NAME;
    - use database command and create the tables;
    - to see the tables inside the database : show tables;
    - create new table : create table student(id int, name varchar(50), address varchar(100));
    - see the table structure: desc student;
    - insert row/record into the table:
        insert into student(name) values('pranav');
        insert into student(id,name,address) values(1,'akash','pune');
        insert into student values(2,'rohan','mumbai');

    - check how many rows/records are there
        select * from table_name;

    - delete the rows
            delete from student where id=1;

    - drop the table
        drop table student;

    delete vs drop:
        - delete will delete the content from table
        - drop will delete the entire table from the given database;


Before we execute these queries we have to connect to the database server:
    mysql -u user_name -p password

SQL queries:
    create new database: create database db_name;
    see all databases: show databases;
    use the database : use db_name;
    create the table: create able Table_Name(column_name, column_dataType);
    see the structure of table: desc table_name;
    insert new record in the table: INSERT INTO Table_Name (column_name) values (value);
    see the records in the table: select * from table_name;
    update record in the table : UPDATE table_name SET column_name = new_value WHERE column_name=value
    delete all the records from table : delete from table_name;
    drop the table from db : drop table table_name;
